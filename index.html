    <h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
    <p>
      I am a third year undergraduate student of the department of Chemical
      Engineering enrolled in it's B.Tech course. I like to apply my technical
      skills, accrued from my engineering studies to conflux the spheres of
      technology and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my undergraduate courses so far, I have outlined certain specific
      goals to help me grow holistically. The primary ones among these are to
      get an experience of the corporate world, an exposure in the field of
      artificial intelligence, and machine learning along with developing a
      network of intellectuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it is academics or management, challenging real-life
      problem-solving always attracts me. In the quest to expand my horizons, I
      have constantly aimed at pursuing diverse interests, and thereby, in
      addition to academic proficiency, I have inculcated in myself leadership
      and management skills through the numerous position of responsibilities
      that I have undertaken.
